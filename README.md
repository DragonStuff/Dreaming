# Dreaming
A simple web page app designed to assist in the performing of reality checks for those who practice lucid dreaming.

Works on all browsers from a mobile to a 60" 4k LCD Smart TV (_not tested_).

##Installation Instructions
This requires a web server with PHP. Just place the contents of this repository into a serveable directory and it will work out of the box.

Note: _I realised after finishing that I could have made the whole thing in Javascript. Maybe I'll re-write it soon._
